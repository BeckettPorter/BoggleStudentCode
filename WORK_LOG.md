| April 5      |     9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 6th  |  1:00 - 1:45pm  |                           I began working on a first version, I realized my strategy to approaching it that I used on the final is not going to work so I am completely rethinking it. I think I will use DFS and a stack instead of a queue and I also chose to make a BoardPoint java class to store things such as if it is visited. I could do this with just an array of booleans I just realized, so maybe that was overkill but it should work either way. |
| January 6th  |  8:50 - 9:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I started working more on my method I think will work, basically a depth first search and set which points have been visited. I made a helper method to give me the surrounding points that are in the board, it shouldn't go out of bounds. |
| January 7th  | 12:50 - 1:25pm  |                                         I made another helper method to check if a given prefix is in any word in the dictionary. This should help in determining if it is worth continuing down a given path any more. I don't fully understand still how I should go about removing a point from a word, like do I remove the character I just added from that point? I'll need to figure this out, however it did somehow complete the test edge case somehow. |
| January 8th  | 11:15 - 11:50pm | I completely redid my main method and made it do depth first search recursively. I think this hypothetically should be easier than doing it iteratively, not sure if it actually will be tho. I have a good number of helper methods that I think work, if not that would suck though because I am debugging kind of assuming that they do. It's more likely there's an issue with the logic in my depth first search than my helper methods being wrong I think. |
| January 8th  |  3:00 - 3:12pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I added the TST and remade code to use it. It doesn't work anymore but at least its a lot faster. |
| January 12th |  11:10-11:30am  |                                                            I decided to not do the thing where I changed the prefix search method because it was incredibly scuffed and was breaking everything. Instead I just tried to find other places to optimize and I was able to get the test edge case to around 400ms. I mainly just optimized by changing the order of some things in my DFS method so it won't do unnecessary work. I'll add comments now and submit. |
