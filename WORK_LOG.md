| January 6th | 1:00 - 1:45pm | I began working on a first version, I realized my strategy to approaching it that I used on the final is not going to work so I am completely rethinking it. I think I will use DFS and a stack instead of a queue and I also chose to make a BoardPoint java class to store things such as if it is visited. I could do this with just an array of booleans I just realized, so maybe that was overkill but it should work either way. |
